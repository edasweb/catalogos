"Akrapovic,958.58,M-FI/SS/1H,Abarth 500/500C Akrapovic Slip-On Line (SS),EC Type Approval,""Add a stainless steel Slip-On exhaust system and make the Abarth (1.4 16V T Jet) even faster, even more responsive, and give it an even more striking look and that unmistakable sporty Akrapovič sound. The biggest difference compared to stock is most noticeable when the optional Akrapovic sound kit for adjustable sound is used. When the exhaust valve is open, the sound becomes significantly deeper and tastefully louder, but still entirely without droning. Performance facts apply to the performance exhaust with the Akrapovic sound kit and open valves. The system without the Akrapovic sound kit has a point-welded block in the link pipe that prevents bypassing the muffler. Please note: when the bypass is unblocked, the EC type approval is not valid. Complete the look with a set of exquisite 115 mm tailpipes in either titanium or carbon fibre.Warning: This product will not fit on US spec Abarth."""

The exhaust valve – with its housing cast in the in-house foundry – gives the exhaust a rich sound with an emphasis on high frequencies, especially when shifting through the gears, all allied to a deep tone that enhances the car’s engine without any discomfort or drone for the occupants. A specially engineered Y-split reduces the flow noise without any compromise to the pressure pulse distribution, thus offering a strong sound and optimal flow path. The use of lightweight materials and a different configuration reduces the overall weight of the exhaust by 9.4 kg, a saving of 55.6% on the stock version.

This addition is primarily designed for track use and will create a pure racing sound for the engine. Equipped with a high-flow 200 CPSI sport catalytic converter, the downpipe eliminates the OPF for a completely different sensory experience the moment the driver’s foot comes down! The sound level is noticeably increased and accompanied by a deep and powerful tone in the low and mid rev ranges, developing into a pure race-derived acoustic delight in high revs, which the occupants simply won’t get enough of! Every gear shift is full of crackling sounds, and the exhilarating tone is accompanied by an exciting burbling on every over-run in the sportiest settings. Despite being a track-oriented system, it retains all the comfort when you want it in Comfort mode, with no unwanted sounds or drone in the cabin.When installing the Akrapovič Downpipe with Cat, remapping the ECU is mandatory to prevent potential “check engine light” warning signals.FITMENT NOTICE: This product fits 2021 vehicles equipped with an Otto/gasoline particulate filter.THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT MEET EMISSION COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET OR HIGHWAY USE."""
"Akrapovic,9694.91,S-ME/TI/1H/1,Mercedes-AMG Coupé GT / GT S / GT C Akrapovic Evolution Line (Titanium),ECE Type Approval,""The Evolution Line (Titanium) takes these cars to heightened levels of auditory excitement, enhanced performance, and stunning good looks, all with a perfectly sculpted exhaust made from ultra-lightweight titanium alloys that reduce the weight from the stock exhaust by over 46%. Finished with hand-crafted carbon-fibre tailpipes, this exhaust has a stunning soundtrack and that unique Akrapovič signature. The sound is controlled by a complex X-connection, cast in the in-house titanium foundry, with a precisely machined valve flap to alter the tones, which can be controlled with a console button inside the cabin or by the Sound Remote Controller of the optional Akrapovič Sound Kit. When the X-connection valve is open, the exhaust system delivers a more continuous, smooth, and harmonic sound for a more comfortable ride, and in closed mode the acoustics have been maximised to give the cars a pure sporty and intense muscle-car V8 roar. Power and torque levels are increased throughout the entire rev range. It is ECE approved, so no re-map or other parts are needed and it is a simple plug-and-play installation.Fitting information for GT/GT Roadster models: the Evolution system only fits cars equipped with the AMG Performance exhaust.Fittment notice:This system does not fit on vehicles equipped with Otto particulate filter (OPF)."""

"Akrapovic,2744.28,S-TY/T/2,Toyota GR Yaris Akrapovic Slip-On Race Line (Titanium),,""This exhaust is produced using race-proven, high-grade titanium for the entire system and features megaphone-shaped tailpipes. A collector centred between the rear resonators has been cast in the in-house foundry; this collector optimizes and balances the gas flow to produce an acoustically tuned sound with no drone. Three resonators – two at the back of the collector and one in the middle pipe – further tune the sound experience to create a sporty racing tone, fully enhancing the engine’s characteristics with a deep and enthusiastic sound, to give the occupants a feeling of exhilaration that is never interrupted by excess noise. The engineers have placed a special emphasis on the acoustics in the middle and high rev range, with a high-frequency tone at higher rpms and more sound at idle and revving. This sound is managed by two megaphone-shaped titanium tailpipes that are welded to the exhaust and specially coated to resist any colour changes at high temperatures. The shape of the tailpipes influences the sound. They are bigger than stock, measuring in at 110 mm, and have a similar profile to the Akrapovič exhaust for the Toyota GR Supra. Developed to decrease back pressure, the system weighs in at 7,8 kg, which is 37 % lighter than stock and yields power gains of 9.5 kW (12.9 hp) at 6,950 rpm and torque increases of 13.0 Nm at 6,950 rpm when tested on the Akrapovič dyno against a Toyota GR Yaris with a standard stock exhaust. This exhaust is designed for use on racetracks and closed courses only. It is necessary to cut the stock exhaust system when installing this product, but no ECU remapping is needed for this configuration.An optional Evolution link pipe is available for customers looking to extend the exhaust tuning possibilities for even better performance of the Akrapovič Slip-On Race Line (Titanium) system.THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT MEET EMISSION COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET OR HIGHWAY USE."""

The sound is further enhanced by a tuned resonator in the middle part of the link pipe, calculated to deliver a perfect sound experience, serving up a deep, rich, and sporty sound with no drone or streaming, to create a pure three-cylinder racing sound from the engine. It delivers power and torque increases of 13.5 kW (18.4 hp) at 5,900 rpm and 21.8 Nm at 5,900 rpm when using a combination of the Slip-On Race Line (Titanium) with an Evolution Link Pipe (SS) and tested on the Akrapovič dyno against a GR Yaris with a standard stock exhaust.
